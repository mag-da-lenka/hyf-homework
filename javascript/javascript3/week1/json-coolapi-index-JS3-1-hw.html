  <h2>1. my JSON file</h2>

  <p>Please see: <br> 1. the code/console here and <br> 2. a separate JSON file named --> jsonMomoa. </p> <br>

  <h2>2. cool API explained </h2>

  <p>
    I am currently using the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/current">Current Weather Data API</a> to build a
    weather app (please see exercise 3 in a separate set of files).

    It gives the developer access to data from weather stations around the world. For my class exercise I only need
    information about Copenhagen, but there are over 200,000 cities available to choose from.

    The data can be accessed in 3 formats: JSON, XML, or HTML. My task is to use JSON (Java Script Object Notation).
  </p>
  <p>
    To be able to render it on the app I'm building I had to ...
  </p>
  <p>1. ... sign for an API key, which is basically my unique password.
    Wiki says that it's "a unique identifier used to authenticate a user, developer, or calling program to an API.
    However, they are typically used to authenticate a project with the API rather than a human user. Different
    platforms may implement and use API keys in different ways."
  </p>
  <p>
    2. ... use fetch + response to connect
  </p>
  <p>
    3. ... use the knowledge about accessing objects and arrays because the data in JSON in a Javascript file is shown
    as an object and the values of its keys can be eg. objects, arrays, strings numbers. If you want to check my
    understanding of the above please see the JS file or open the console while browsing exercise 3.
    The general rule for accessing and object is to chain its values and for the arrays you need to specify the index
    you are interested with. <br>
    When it comes to further understanding of the JSON syntax, please see the JS file attached to this exercise and see
    my comments.
  </p>
  <p>
    PS. The data content is obviously dynamic just as the weather so everytime you refresh the browser, something new
    might appear and that's the point. :)
